title: Native Applications with the Web Technologies

It is easier than it seems to get a desktop application started with `atom-shell`. [`releases`](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases) of `atom-shell` can be downloaded easily.

[MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1) allows developers to easily create web applications for OSX similar to how PhoneGap allows this for iOS and Android. [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1) is originally a port of `Phonegap-mac`. Slack uses MacGap to power a webview for their native OSX client.

[Node-webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/tree/master) recently renamed to NW.js, and [Bracket-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell) are available as well. But `atom-shell` stood out to me at the easiest project to start with. I was running the quick start "hello world" within 5 minutes.

The speed at which you can move developing a web application by using open source libraries is unreal.

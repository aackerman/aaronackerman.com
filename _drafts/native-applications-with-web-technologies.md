title: Native Applications with the Web Technologies
---

The speed at which you can move developing a web application by using open source libraries is unreal. Web technologies are extremely expressive and dynamic. But often users want an app instead of a website, a single entry point on their desktop. Web tech inside a native shell can provide this experience.

It is easier than it seems to get a desktop application started with `atom-shell`. [`releases`](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/releases) of `atom-shell` can be downloaded. Do the [quick start](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md) in 5 minutes. And you have a "hello, world" for a native application. That's amazing that it can be that easy combining with web technologies.

[MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1) allows developers to easily create web applications for OSX similar to how PhoneGap allows this for iOS and Android. [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1) is originally a port of `Phonegap-mac`. Slack uses MacGap to power a webview for their native OSX client.

[Node-webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/tree/master) recently renamed to NW.js is available as well. `atom-shell` stood out to me at the easiest project to start with. I was running the quick start "hello world" within 5 minutes.

All of these are great projects, any one could knock your app's requirements right out of the park. Your requirements drive the choice.
